Files and Colab notebooks to showcase my skills for data analytics.

Google Colab is part of your free Google account, just as Google Docs.  Simply log in to your Google account and go to https://research.colab.com.  Click on WELCOME TO COLABORATORY and then on COPY TO DRIVE and Colab will be available in your Google Drive. 

No installations are required, as these files can be opened by using Google Colab (on Google Drive). Anyone with a Google account can use it. It is as simple to open a notebook as a Google Doc.
